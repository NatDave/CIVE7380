# CIVE 7380: Performance Models and Simulation of Transportation Networks

I created this repo for the course CIVE 7380 while studying at Northeastern University. This repository contains resources, assignments, and mini projects focused on analyzing, simulating, and optimizing transportation networks. Throughout the course, I worked on real-world applications in traffic flow modeling, network optimization, and performance simulation, solidifying my knowledge of transportation systems. Each project was **completed by me**, demonstrating my proficiency in applying theoretical models to practical transportation problems.

## Course Overview  
CIVE 7380 explores methods for analyzing the performance of complex transportation systems through various models and simulation techniques. The course provides insights into planning, design, monitoring, and managing traffic flows within transportation networks. Key topics include:  

- **Deterministic and Probabilistic Models**  
- **Elements of Queuing Theory**  
- **Network Optimization Algorithms**  
- **Simulation of Traffic Flows**  
- **Capacity Analysis of Diverse Transportation Facilities**  
- **Level of Service and Delay Estimation**  
- **Optimal Design of Transportation Network Services**  
- **Traffic Assignment on Congested Networks**  

This course equipped me with practical and theoretical knowledge in evaluating transportation systems' performance, applying optimization techniques, and using simulation to model real-world scenarios in transportation planning and traffic control.
